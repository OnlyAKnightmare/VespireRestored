To serve his will is to accept the call to conflict, seeking lesser people to break and subjugate.

Soldiers fear succumbing to his blood lust lest they dishonor themselves, but the vengeful and forsaken call to him for the gift of his rage. Bane revels in sadism, destruction, and the utter humiliation of the vanquished. He drives warriors to acts of cruelty and malice in their pursuit of victory. Only those who have experienced the terror and violence of war truly understand the seductive nature of Bane's power. To feel rage, to be an instrument of wrath—these emotions override the fear of battle. In hatred there is strength, and Bane revels in this fact.

Angels more aligned to law respect him for his commitment to order while fiends admire the bloodlust and violence he commands and commits. He has both angels and fiends serving as commanders of his many legions, taking the fight to the Hells. Because of this, while Bane believed himself the rightful ruler of all the planes and could not tolerate subservience to anyone, the god was willing, unlike many evil deities, to work with others if it served his interests and the god has formed multiple alliances. It is not unheard of for followers of Erathis or Moradin to work together to help create tactics or war machines even with a millennia of bad blood spilt between the three clashing Gods. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"> </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\">Bane is often depicted as a brutish, ogre-like man clad from head to toe in jagged black armor.

Sailors, fishers, and residents of the world's coasts and islands all pay her at least nominal respect and sacrifice. Offerings, so long as they do not harm the waters, are all accepted as long as respectfully given.

Often, mercenaries and guards will train with established groups in the swamps gaining knowledge, equipment, and coin before traveling up north for more lucrative (and riskier) work. </p><p><i>Curse effects</i> - The fogs that raise from the swamp waters here reanimate any dead it comes into contact with.

He used the great wealth he had amassed over the ages to help those in need, while using the magic items he had gathered to further his goals.

Temples and works of art depict a massive, glittering dragon with vibrant platinum scales and seemingly endless wingspan. When he wishes to wander the mortal world, he usually takes the appearance of an old human dressed in simple robes accompanied by seven canaries. Some sages believed Bahamut used this humanoid guise to not frighten non-dragon beings. They also believed that while Bahamut was fond of his old man guise, he had other guises as well. Other recorded guises included that of a prince with a carriage drawn by seven horses, an urchin accompanied by seven friends, and a beggar followed by seven dogs.</span></p><h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:4pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\">Commandments</span></h2><ul style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px\"><li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\">Stand as a paragon of honor and justice.</span></p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\">Smite evil wherever it is found, yet show compassion to those who have strayed from the path of righteousness.</span></p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\">Defend the weak, bring freedom to the persecuted, and protect the ideals of justice and order.</span></p><p></p></li></ul></div></div></div>","markdown":""},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"appendix":false}},"_id":"uT6LnpG0hWkwCDhN","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0},{"name":"Bahamut, The Platinum Dragon (Image)","type":"image","src":"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/deities/EGW/Symbol of Bahamut.png","ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"3ntQwAkDenKANJFM","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0}],"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"deities.html","source":"EGW","hash":"bahamut_exandria_egw"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.deities.ynO7ozFIGrD48SzM"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674085964547,"modifiedTime":1674287720486,"lastModifiedBy":"NmQ2YTNiMzkwN2Jh"},"folder":"HrRcSuKNxgyHTz0P","sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":2,"NmQ2YTNiMzkwN2Jh":3},"_id":"gxM3UGLMGNNTYkwB"}

As an immortal being of freedom and travel, she instructed her followers to move as much as possible from place to place and from activity to activity. She is free, chaotic and impulsive, and does not like to stay in any one place or one form for too long. While she delighted in creating unpredictable weather, including some fairly severe thunderstorms, her primary joy was simply to feel the air around her as she flew high above the ground. However, woe to anyone who deems her thoughtless and without care, for when Aether focuses her attention on a matter she is as precise and swift as a lightning bolt.</strong></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong style=\"font-weight:normal\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-bd7c6d58-7fff-7ada-04ac-30b42522cfa0\"> </strong></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong style=\"font-weight:normal\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-bd7c6d58-7fff-7ada-04ac-30b42522cfa0\">Traveling across the land, listening to the howl of the many winds, spreading the word of Aether's glory, and spontaneously choosing to act upon the interests of the moment are the most common of the activities that the followers of Aether took part in. However, when a sudden interest takes hold where it was only an idea or a whim, it is thought to be a blessing of the goddess. Aether dispenses inspiration without regard for the morality of its application. She is just as likely to reward the shrewd general seeking to topple a city as a gentle healer searching for a cure for a malady. Good and evil don't color her thinking, only action and the thrill of birthing new ideas into the world. Sometimes all it takes is a different point of view or idea to suddenly bring great change and furthering the act of creating—be it ideas, weapons, art, or magic—is what matters most.</strong></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong style=\"font-weight:normal\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-bd7c6d58-7fff-7ada-04ac-30b42522cfa0\"> </strong></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong style=\"font-weight:normal\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-bd7c6d58-7fff-7ada-04ac-30b42522cfa0\">Aether, unlike all the other elemental gods, has a small following. She seems to sometimes forget she even has followers, and usually requires a fitting sacrifice or mortal to catch her attention. One example was the burning of incense that was carried to her on the winds, a necessary action before she would recognize her followers. Appeals to Aether could affect or change the winds, such as producing a strong current of air or even cause a hurricane, but would often not bring the end of more severe storms unless she was greatly pleased.</strong></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong style=\"font-weight:normal\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-bd7c6d58-7fff-7ada-04ac-30b42522cfa0\"> </strong></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong style=\"font-weight:normal\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-bd7c6d58-7fff-7ada-04ac-30b42522cfa0\">For good or ill, Aether exists as a disruptive force. Aether finds satisfaction in investing bright mortals with prescient visions to see how they adapt. She finds satisfaction not only in granting insight, but also in expressing the awesome fury of the storm. Where others see only chaos and destruction in storms, she sees them as shaping the firmament in ways that challenge and engage mortals. Her blasts of lightning set house and forest ablaze, thus rendering the soil clear for new life and new creations. Hers is a vision she alone is equipped to see.</strong></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong style=\"font-weight:normal\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-bd7c6d58-7fff-7ada-04ac-30b42522cfa0\"> </strong></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial\"><strong style=\"font-weight:normal\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-bd7c6d58-7fff-7ada-04ac-30b42522cfa0\">When taking a physical form Aether often took whatever suited her whim at the moment.
