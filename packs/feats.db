If the attack hits, the ally can roll a [[/r d8]] and add the number rolled as a bonus to the attack's damage roll.

Characters can change what knightly order they're a part of, but they always have access to any Knight of Solamnia feats they've acquired.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div>\n\t\t\t</div></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"DSotDQ","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":0,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":0,"long":0,"units":null},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":null,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"4th level, squire of solamnia feat","recharge":{"value":0,"charged":true}},"type":"feat","img":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/mighty-force.svg","flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"feats.html","source":"DSotDQ","hash":"knight%20of%20the%20crown_dsotdq","propDroppable":"feat"}},"effects":[],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674078779404,"modifiedTime":1675294600065,"lastModifiedBy":"NmQ2YTNiMzkwN2Jh"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"NmQ2YTNiMzkwN2Jh":3},"_id":"z5ehcjbqyaFO2QRi"}
