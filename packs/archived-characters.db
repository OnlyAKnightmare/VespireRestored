Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends. You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one. Flood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. Part Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored. Redirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. Whirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"10","units":"minute"},"cover":null,"target":{"value":100,"width":null,"units":"ft","type":"cube"},"range":{"value":300,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"wis","actionType":"util","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":4,"school":"trs","components":{"vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"ritual":false,"concentration":true},"materials":{"value":"A drop of water and a pinch of dust","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}}},{"_id":"YjM1YjEyYTVmMGJi","name":"Death Ward","ownership":{"default":0},"type":"spell","sort":920000,"flags":{"favtab":{"isFavorite":true}},"img":"icons/magic/control/fear-fright-monster-purple-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234149,"modifiedTime":1673071792587,"lastModifiedBy":"MGFjNzI3Zjc5NDQy"},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death.

If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell. A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.</p><p><strong>Higher Level.</strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the Duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"hour","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"24","units":"hour"},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":60,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"wis","actionType":"util","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":5,"school":"abj","components":{"vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"A jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes","consumed":true,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"level","formula":""}}},{"_id":"ZTZjNmY0MzNhYWQ2","name":"Raise Dead","ownership":{"default":0},"type":"spell","sort":1130000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/magic/life/heart-cross-strong-purple-orange.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.0","coreVersion":"10.279","createdTime":1661787234087,"modifiedTime":1661787234087,"lastModifiedBy":"dnd5ebuilder0000"},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days.

If you know a specific creature’s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM’s choice). When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn’t obliged to do so.

You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services. Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you. As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible.

Her father was the chief of the tribe, and Anarchy lived a happy and peaceful life with her family and people up until the age of 3 or 4.</p><p></p><p>Around that time, a foreign visitor under the guise of a young, wounded triton girl came upon the Equillia’s territory seeking help. She expressed to the guards that her home village fell under attack of an enemy clan of sahuagin known as the Ossulako, and that she travelled a great distance in search of help after witnessing her family be slaughtered by the wretched sea devils. While sympathetic to the teenage girl and her story, the guards chose to bring her forth to the chief of the tribe to have him assess the situation. After some light interrogation, Chief Depravity deemed the young girl worthy to stay within the Equillia for however long she needed to, and that any injuries she possessed were to be tended to immediately.</p><p></p><p>All seemed fine and uneventful following the girl’s arrival that day, but when dusk settled in and the majority of the tribe fell to rest, they were attacked in the middle of the night by none other than the Ossulako themselves. People were slain and others incapacitated, and although the Equillia were a strong people with many powerful warriors on their side, the sahuagin matched their skill and strength, and fought until they fully seized control over the tribe. The chief and his wife were apprehended and brought before the Ossulako’s leader who held a great vendetta against the Equillia, and he ordered them to be taken captive by the clan.</p><p></p><p>After the Equillia was conquered, the Ossulako left their victory in the hands of another; the teenage triton girl that infiltrated the tribe only mere hours before. She was not a triton at all, but instead a type of sahuagin referred to as malenti, a subset of the race that bear uncanny physical resemblance to both tritons and sea elves. The young girl was once a respected member of the clan, possessing a true hunger for the destruction of the Ossulako’s enemies, as well as nothing but devotion to the clan and the patron they worshipped. But after a grave mistake that severed her connection with her patron, the clan deemed her weak and disgraceful. In an attempt to redeem herself and restore her patron’s faith in her, she convinced the Ossulako’s leader into letting her join a mission to destroy the Equillia from the inside out. She was only accepted into the task because of her triton-like appearance, but that was just enough to allow her the chance to reclaim her honor.</p><p></p><p>With her patron’s magical gift returned to her, and the trust of her clan won back, the Ossulako’s leader put the malenti girl in charge of their new faction, along with the aid of a few of the clan’s other skilled warriors and magic wielders. After the clan disembarked back to their base with their precious new captives in tow, the malenti girl happily made her way to the chieftain’s quarters where she’d now permanently reside. But, what she found inside one of the bedrooms took her by surprise. The last remnants of the former chief’s reign, his three young daughters, were cowering in a corner, seemingly untouched by the war that had been waged outside. With a devious smile, the malenti girl casted a charm spell upon the three children, and thus, the Vaalstormeth siblings; Mayhem, Tyranny, and Anarchy gained a new sister: Carnage.</p><p></p><p>Many enchantments (predominantly of the memory-modifying variety) were placed upon the Equillia after the domination, to keep them under blissful ignorance lest their disgustingly good-natured determination rise up against the tribe’s new leaders. Ensuring that Carnage could keep the tribe under her thumb, she fabricated a different story for the tribe to believe; that the former chief and his wife, both heroic warriors, fell in a valiant battle against an evil aquatic abomination, giving their lives to save the Equillia. The mantle of leadership was then soon placed upon their eldest daughter, Carnage von Vaalstormeth, to continue on the legacy of the tribe’s fearless champions. And since the younger Vaalstormeth sisters were of such young age, their memories were the easiest to modify, making it almost effortless for Carnage to invent the idea of them having a sister over ten years their senior.</p><p></p><p>To guarantee that the sisters and other figures of importance within the tribe stay under her magical influence, Carnage had some of the skilled sahuagin enchanters create magical items infused with such magic, crafted in the form of jewelry. Anarchy thus received her first, and only gift from Carnage; a golden choker, that when adorned, placed the wearer under a binding curse, unable to take it off under their own volition, lest they experience intense dizziness and hysteria. Tyranny and Mayhem received similar “gifts”, with all the girls so attached to their wonderful presents that they’d never truly realize them to be the shackles that they were.</p><p></p><p>For the following years, the Equillia was led solely by Chieftess Carnage, and though the Equillians still believed they fought for the utmost justice and goodness for the world, Carnage had them unknowingly follow her own agenda of destruction and domination. As the younger Vaalstormeth sisters grew and matured, Carnage chose to deploy a new tactic of manipulation. As a show of “respect” to her “sisters”, Carnage bestowed upon them their own status of chieftess, assigning them to co-lead the tribe and feel as though they held as much power as she did. The younger sisters took care of certain needs of the tribe that Carnage couldn’t always give her attention to; Mayhem, the eldest after Carnage, became the general of the Equillia’s army; Tyranny, the middle child, became the Equillia’s head arcanist after discovering that she possessed sorcerous magic early in her youth; and Anarchy, the youngest, was the leader of the tribe’s scouting parties, in charge of scavenging for food, supplies, and other useful resources.</p><p></p><p>Things went smoothly for the tribe for a number of years, the enchantment upon its people showing no error for quite a while. That is, until a certain day inevitably arrived. An Equillian soldier was slowly breaking from the charm cast upon him, and though not all of his memories had returned yet, he knew that Carnage could not be trusted, and attempted to form a secret rebellion against her. Carnage quickly caught wind of his measly little plot, and had the other Equillian guards seize him so he could be brought forth to the chiefstesses for punishment.</p><p></p><p>Carnage spun the story to make it seem like the warrior had secretly been feeding information to the Equillia’s enemies, and declared that he should be sentenced to death for his crimes. The other sisters were wary of Carnage’s proclamation; Anarchy most of all. The thought of killing one of their fellow Equillians felt like a betrayal to everything they as a tribe stood for, and so she decided to take a stand against Carnage’s decision. She tried to plead with her elder sister to give the traitor a fairer punishment, but this did nothing but enrage Carnage. And instead of her sisters coming to Anarchy’s defense, Mayhem and Tyranny tried to get her to back down and apologize for her objection. But Anarchy couldn’t let herself do that, not when it was a matter of life and death for her fellow Equillian.</p><p></p><p>All of a sudden, Carnage’s hostility seemed to fade, and she beckoned forth a guard to acquire a weapon from him; one of the Equillian’s finely crafted spears. Knowing that this was Anarchy’s favored weapon of choice, she quickly thrusted the spear into the younger triton’s arms, and told that in order for her to prove herself worthy as a chieftess of the Equillia, she was to commit the execution herself. Anarchy, naturally, was terrified by this, but all her sisters looked toward her expectantly, and she knew what had to be done.</p><p></p><p>But, she couldn’t go through with it. She couldn’t bring herself to kill one of her own people—maybe anyone at all, for that matter—and she subsequently collapsed into a sobbing mess on the floor of the chieftain’s quarters. Disgusted and infuriated, Carnage took the spear she gave to Anarchy and did the job herself, killing the defenseless soldier for everyone in the main hall to see. Anarchy stayed traumatized on the floor of the chieftain’s quarters until Carnage eventually demanded for her to stay the night in one of the guest rooms, which she didn’t dare to disobey.</p><p></p><p>At some point in the evening, Anarchy was visited by a worried-looking Tyranny, who explained to her that Carnage wished to speak with her outside of the chieftain’s quarters. Anarchy chose not to question it, and followed her sister outside into the settlement’s main square. From there, her arms were quickly seized by two guards, and the other chiefstesses approached the scene along with an onlooking crowd of other denizens of the tribe. Though Tyranny and Mayhem stood present behind Carnage with remorse on their faces, they kept quiet while Carnage spoke out to the rest of the tribe. She declared Anarchy a traitor to the Equillia for choosing to protect an enemy over their people, and that her betrayal should be paid for with the same fate the rebel met. But, as a final act of sisterly love, Carnage chose to give Anarchy one last chance at survival.</p><p></p><p>And suddenly, Anarchy was attacked by multiple other guards, and proceeded to be violently chased out of the Equillia’s encampment for a duration that felt like a lifetime. In an attempt to escape her assailants, Anarchy swam upwards toward the surface of the ocean. Though she’d never been above water before, neither had most others within the Equillia, so it seemed like it was her only choice left. As she continued her venture to the water’s surface, she heard the voice of Carnage call after her, warning her to never return to the tribe.</p><p></p><p>Anarchy found herself struggling with the uncomfortable new style of breathing after she broke the surface, and with her energy quickly depleting, she used what little strength she had left in her to get to safety upon a flat rock jutting out of the water. She was gravely wounded, with nowhere left to go, and so Anarchy cried out in despair, realizing she was likely going to die there, exiled and disgraced by her people.</p><p></p><p>But, miraculously, a passing cargo ship upon the sea that night spotted the odd creature that was Anarchy lying on the rocks in the middle of the ocean, and the two sailors on watchmen duty that night quickly alerted the rest of the crew of the person in trouble. They managed to rescue Anarchy and tend to her injuries before she could succumb to them, saving her life. When Anarchy finally came to after a long period of unconsciousness, she met the pair of sailors that saved her; two halfling brothers named Benji and Callen Blackmello. They were greatly concerned for her, questioning what happened to her and whatnot. But upon noticing Anarchy’s sadness, they decided it was best to save the questions for a later time.</p><p></p><p>Benji and Callen took it upon themselves to provide Anarchy with further help, and welcomed her to their home within a lovely coastal town known as the Lambent Promenade. Anarchy came to live with the two brothers and their wives, Ceren and Rissa, and became the newest addition to the Blackmello household. While she became close with everyone in the family, she formed a special mother-daughter bond with Ceren. Some time after settling into her new life, Ceren introduced Anarchy to her worship of the god of light, Pelor, of which she was a priestess at the town’s local temple. Anarchy became a quick follower of the deity, and would frequently join Ceren at the sanctuary, and prayed to Pelor at every sunrise and sunset.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, Pelor chose to bestow a mote of divine power onto the devout follower that was Anarchy, allowing her to wield clerical magic. She used this blessing to impart all the goodness and light that she could upon the world, often using it against any threats that attacked the town on rare occasions. Though Anarchy herself was a skilled warrior, she lacked the proper weaponry and protection to fight on the front lines when the Lambent Promenade was in danger. Fortunately, Rissa was a blacksmith with an expertise in combat utility, and eventually forged Anarchy her very own spear and set of armor.</p><p></p><p>Anarchy was happy with her life on the surface for a while. However, despite her love for her new friends and new home, a part of her yearned to explore further beyond Lambent Promenade. She contained her wanderlust for as long as she could, but it inevitably reached the point where others began to take notice. Benji and Callen sat down and had a talk with her about it. They assured Anarchy that she had no reason to feel bad or guilty for her desire to explore; she had lived in the town for over three years at that point, it was completely natural to yearn for more. Reluctantly, Anarchy heeded the brothers’ words, and packed her bags one day to set off on an adventure. It was hard for her to part with the Blackmellos, especially since Rissa was pregnant at the time, but she insisted that she’d return eventually and recite all the tales that her journey brought.</p><p></p><p>And thus, with a tearful farewell and a generous trust-fund, Anarchy disembarked into the open world. In only a few months, she already experienced many wonders that the world held, and found friends in many like-minded adventurers that she would accompany for a little while before eventually setting off on her own once again. She could never be quite sure of what her next adventure would entail, but Anarchy was brimming with excitement for everything next to come!</p><p></p></section><hr /><section><p><strong>Additional Features and Traits :</strong></p><p>Notes:</p><p></p><p>- Every night before she goes to sleep, Anarchy takes the time to look at the stars in the night sky. It’s a coping mechanism for her, being able to look at and count the stars as a way to calm down and remember tomorrow’s another day. She’s very much infatuated with the night sky because it was the very first thing Anarchy saw when she emerged from the sea after being banished. Since she was injured and scared, seeing the night sky for the first time was mesmerizing for her, pulling her attention away from her pain and problems and letting her feel at peace for a moment. Even if she doesn’t get to look at the stars right before bed, she still tries to take any chance she gets during the night to look at them, if just for a little bit. If she can’t see the stars, she tries to envision them in her mind. She often prays during this time as well, as it’s helped get her through some of her most stressful and emotional hardships in the past years she’s been on the surface.</p><p></p><p></p><p>- The golden choker Anarchy wears was a “gift” from Carnage. She received it when she was young after Carnage had invaded the tribe, and Anarchy regards it with much love and sentiment. The choker is infused with magic, and as long as Anarchy wears it, she’s under a charm that has altered her memories and keeps her under the impression of Carnage being her sister. She rarely ever takes it off because, as a part of its magical enchantment, the choker is an anchor for these memories that have been embedded into Anarchy’s mind, so when it’s unequipped, Anarchy becomes dizzy and disoriented, and has a hard time focusing and understanding her surroundings. Its magical compulsion leads her into putting it back on, yet she never remembers this side effect when she wears it again. And with her emotional connection to it, Anarchy doesn’t like taking it off anyway, because she feels it’s truly a special gift from Carnage that gives her hope that maybe Carnage and the other sisters still love her.</p><p></p><p></p><p>- Anarchy has a lot of self-confidence issues, which include a lot of self-loathing tendencies. Though she’s naturally a happy person, and is very happy with her life on the surface world, as she began to relax into her new life, she started to hate the way she looks and the way she acts. She already feels as though she’s still a weak, scared little girl like her sisters and tribe condemned her for being, so her actions regarding taking lives further cements these thoughts that she’s still too weak to do what’s necessary for defending herself and the ones she loves. Anarchy has come to dislike the way she looks because her differences keep her feeling outcast and isolated from others. She hasn’t been able to make very many friendships outside of her halfling fellows because people are commonly put off by her abnormalities, and she understands this. Anarchy doesn’t want to change the way she looks, but she doesn’t think she’s beautiful compared to people on the surface and struggles with these insecurities greatly. It’s why she’s grown so attached to her current new friends, because they view her like a normal person and don’t look at her so strangely.</p><p></p><p></p><p>- Anarchy is terrified of pitch-darkness. She can manage in dark areas with little light, but she gets immensely anxious and fearful when she's surrounded in complete darkness with no source of light. She can only last so long in pitch-darkness before she starts panicking and immediately needs to bring forth a light source, whether it be through a spell or some other means.</p><p></p><p></p><p>- Due to Carnage’s influence on her, Carnage embedded into Anarchy’s mind that it's wrong to put other people in a status akin to family. She’s made her believe that the strongest, most sacred relationship people can have is blood-related family, and friends and lovers cannot compare to blood family’s importance. It was just another manipulation tactic to keep the sisters under Carnage’s thumb, but even after being banished, this mentality hasn't changed much for Anarchy. She loves all her friends very, very dearly, but in her mind, she’s not allowed to ever refer to them as “family” as that’s a word she believes can only belong to people she’s related to. So whenever Anarchy hears people refer to others that aren’t blood-related to each other as family, she can’t help but feel so confused and a little uncomfortable. Anarchy’s under the impression that it’s a cultural difference, but in reality, triton culture isn’t like this at all, and was just something Carnage made up.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>- Info on Anarchy's halfling friends:</p><p></p><p>Benji is younger than Callen by 1 year, and they have a sister named Nora that's 3-4 years younger than them—however, she chose to move away from Lambent Promenade a year or two before Anarchy arrived to pursue a life she dreamed of. They’re all in their 30s, and the brothers began their sailing career in their late teens. Ceren is the priestess of the town’s local temple of Light, and Rissa works as a blacksmith. Callen and Rissa are a lot rowdier and more rambunctious compared to Benji and Ceren, who are more well-mannered and a little uptight. Ceren has a very motherly type of affection for Anarchy, as she’s a person who’s not able to bear children and sees Anarchy as a little blessing that came to make up for her unfortunate infertility. Anarchy loves each and all of the family equally, but she goes to Ceren the most for guidance and advice. She’s developed a strong bond with them all though, and loves to tag along with Benji and Callen on sailing trips, and had gotten Rissa to forge her armor and weapon for her. Nora is a musician, and though she wasn't super present in Anarchy's life because of her new home and career, Anarchy was always excited whenever Nora came to visit, and Nora played a big part in Anarchy’s love of music and singing. Currently, the whole family is missing Anarchy very much, and are hoping that she's safe and well, and can't wait to see her again. (Ceren also makes really good cinnamon buns that Anarchy adores.)</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>- Info on Anarchy's sisters:</p><p></p><p>All the sisters have a 2 year age gap (Anarchy being 21, Tyranny being 23, and Mayhem being 25) except for Carnage, who is currently 33 years old, as she was a teenager when the Ossulako invaded and the sisters were young children. Mayhem is a bit stubborn and temperamental, but has a feisty, courageous heart full of compassion, and loves her family more than anything else. Tyranny is a lot more patient and understanding, but also eccentric and lively much like Anarchy is, though she despises conflict and confrontation, making her cowardly as a result. Carnage is ruthless in her actions and doesn't believe in mercy, but feigns a sense of righteousness and integrity to reassure the tribe that the actions they commit are for the greater good. She still shows affection to the sisters to keep them gullible and unaware of her manipulation, but it varies in form and degree. She shows them praise and love in widely spread amounts, with only hints of affection and validation sprinkled in every so often, that way she leaves the sisters craving to please her and gain more of her approval and love. Carnage is very good at lying and faking emotion, and can make anyone feel guilty when they've done nothing wrong. Mayhem and Tyranny miss Anarchy tremendously, but Carnage never forgets to remind them of why they had to do what they did.</p></section><hr /><section><p><strong>Allies &amp; Organizations :</strong></p><p>Organizations:</p><p></p><p>The Equillia (Formerly)</p><p>----------------------------------------------</p><p>Allies:</p><p></p><p>Benji Blackmello (Close friend, Alive) (Halfling)</p><p>Callen Blackmello (Close friend, Alive) (Halfling)</p><p>Ceren Silvercreek (Close friend, Alive) (Halfling)</p><p>Rissa Lighterdale (Close friend, Alive) (Halfling)</p><p></p><p>Party Members:</p><p></p><p>Asmund Hartvigsen (Friend, Alive) (Half-Elf)</p><p>Yathun Moonwalker (Ally, Alive) (Elf)</p><p>Bhalnur Stonesetter (Ally, Alive) (Dwarf)</p><p></p><p>Former Party Members:</p><p></p><p>Bwah (Friend, Alive?)

Staring at it for a few minutes will result in hearing the sound of the ocean in the distance. While attuned to this item you may use your reaction whenever an ally deals damage to an enemy you can see within 30 feet of you to deal 1d12 cold damage. You can do this a number of times a day equal to your proficiency modifier, resetting after a long rest. You also have advantage on investigation rolls made to discover hidden items or doorways, as the pearl seems to 'sense' hidden treasure.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, whenever you cast a spell that deals damage, you can change the damage type to Cold, Lightning, or Thunder damage, and you may add your proficiency modifier to the damage roll of any spell equal to level 1 or higher.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Field Healer's Pauldron</p><p>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</p><p></p><p>This iron pauldron bears a faded healer's emblem and holds up a rugged shoulder cape. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a die to restore hit points to a creature (including yourself), you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. In addition, once on each of your turns when you restore hit points to a creature using a spell of 1st level or higher, you can grant that creature the benefits of the bless spell until the start of your next turn. If the spell targets multiple creatures, you choose one of them to gain the benefits.</p><p></p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Stuffy Familiar</p><p>Wondrous item, uncommon</p><p></p><p>This small stuffed animal is soft to the touch and perfect for hugging. You can cast the find familiar spell using the stuffy, and you can use the animal as the material component for the spell, without it being consumed. When you do, the familiar inhabits the form of the stuffed animal, whose appearance you can change as part of casting the spell in this way. The familiar is a construct, in addition to being either a celestial, fey, or fiend, but its statistics are otherwise unchanged from its normal form. The familiar's stuffed animal form must be appropriate to the statistics of its normal animal one. For example, a familiar within a griffon stuffed animal could use the statistics for a cat or hawk, but not a poisonous snake. The stuffed animal grows or shrinks to match the size of the familiar's normal form.</p><p></p><p>While the familiar remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal stuffed animal. If you temporarily dismiss the familiar, the stuffed animal and familiar disappear into a pocket dimension together. If the familiar is dismissed forever or drops to 0 hit points, it leaves the stuffed animal behind.</p><p></p><p>---------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Cloak of Protection</p><p>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</p><p></p><p>You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while you wear this cloak.</p><p></p><p>---------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Trident of Warning</p><p>Weapon (trident), uncommon</p><p></p><p>This magic weapon warns you of danger.

When Niku hatched, her mother, Eszaa, was incredibly disappointed that Niku appeared more human than even that of Eszaa who was already pretty human-like. Not only did the yuan-ti around her reject Niku as one of them, but so did her mother. When Niku was around 8 years old, she fled the yuan-ti society and found passage to Fleetsport. There, she was homeless for a short time before an old fisherman and his wife found her and took her in as their own. They taught her of human traditions and eventually how to fish and sail. Once she was old enough, Niku found work for many different ships and crews in the city as a sailor.

As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you're producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p><p></p><p>Tools Required You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an 'M' component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, \"Equipment,\" in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools.</p><p></p><p>After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p><p></p><p>The Magic of ArtificeAs an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist's supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker's tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p><p></p><p>The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p><p></p><p>Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p><p></p><p>Cantrips (0-Level Spells) At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p><p></p><p>When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p><p></p><p>Preparing and Casting Spells The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p></p><p>You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell).

They had killed Claira's vampire sire and now sought to end her unlife as well. While his parents fought them off they told Asmund to run and he ran off towards the forests of the Lowlands. The last thing he saw was his father being struck down and the last thing he heard was his mother cry out in anguish.</p><p></p><p>He spent weeks in the forest before coming back home. He found it in disarray and with his parents corpses laying next to each other. He dug them a grave as best he could and asked whatever god would have them be happy together in the afterlife. After that he took whatever he thought was useful from his home and went back to the forests in case the people who killed his family were still around.</p><p></p><p>He spent years in the forests, his hunger being supplemented by blood, before being found a a traveling village. They took him in and he found a friend in a in-training druid, a young girl named Linnette.</p><p></p><p>They spent years together; she was the one who made the black hair dye to hide his natural white hair and drew tattoos on his body as practice for her coming vocation.

He focused himself on avenging his family and has been hunting down the group that was there that day. </p><p></p><p>He made some success and claimed one of their number.

See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</p><p></p><p>Cantrips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p><p></p><p>Spellbook At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p><p></p><p>Preparing and Casting Spells The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p></p><p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p></p><p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p></p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><p></p><p>Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your wizard spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p></p><p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p></p><p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p></p><p>Ritual Casting You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p><p></p><p>Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p><p></p><p>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see \"Your Spellbook\").</p><p></p><p>Your SpellbookThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p><p></p><p>A spellbook doesn't contain cantrips.</p><p></p><p>Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p><p></p><p>Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p><p></p><p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p><p></p><p>Copying from a Spell Scroll. A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p><p></p><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p><p></p><p>The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Class","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"Wizard 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"ZTY3ODhhYWMyZDVk","name":"Cantrip Versatility","folder":null,"flags":{},"type":"feat","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/63bdcc5d8e4eb1567a1427a5/worlds/the-judgement-of-vespire/characters/048_-_Greable_Flickerbraid/avatar.png","sort":90000,"effects":[],"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>1st-level wizard feature (enhances Spellcasting)</p><p></p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the wizard spell list.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Class","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"Wizard 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"NWUyMWRiYTI3ZGQx","name":"Proficiency Versatility","folder":null,"flags":{},"type":"feat","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/63bdcc5d8e4eb1567a1427a5/worlds/the-judgement-of-vespire/characters/048_-_Greable_Flickerbraid/avatar.png","sort":100000,"effects":[],"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>4th-level feature (enhances Ability Score Improvement)</p><p></p><p>When you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature from your class, you can also replace one of your skill proficiencies with a skill proficiency offered by your class at 1st level (the proficiency you replace needn't be from the class).</p><p></p><p>This change represents one of your skills atrophying as you focus on a different skill.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Class","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"Wizard 4","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"MDgyMGIwNDUyNGQx","name":"School of Illusion","folder":null,"flags":{},"type":"feat","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/63bdcc5d8e4eb1567a1427a5/worlds/the-judgement-of-vespire/characters/048_-_Greable_Flickerbraid/avatar.png","sort":110000,"effects":[],"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal. When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature. Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it.
